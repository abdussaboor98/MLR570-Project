   abstract = {Flight delays negatively impact costs, customer satisfaction, and revenue in the aviation industry. As a result, it is critical to identify the factors that cause flight delays for each airport, as they can vary depending on various attributes associated with their operations. This study proposes an explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) methodology for identifying the features that affect airport delays by integrating data from multiple sources and implementing explainable artificial intelligence. The methodology incorporates operational data, airport information, geographic data, and weather data combined and used to train a series of machine learning models. Furthermore, the SHAP and Sobol techniques are used to thoroughly analyze the features that influence flight delays for the specific case of the airport in Santiago, Chile. The results show that a linear discriminant analysis model is best suited for predicting flight delays in this specific case study, and the features that have the most significant impact on delays are the international flight status, average temperature at the destination airport, wind speed, and average temperature at Santiago airport. The proposed methodology could be applied by airlines that can collect data from multiple sources and conduct similar investigations, leading to the development of a decision support system to make better-informed decisions and reduce the impact of flight delays.},

Gradient descent can be used for fine-tuning the weights in such ``autoencoder'' networks, but this works well only if the initial weights are close to a good solution. We describe an effective way of initializing the weights that allows deep autoencoder networks to learn low-dimensional codes that work much better than principal components analysis as a tool to reduce the dimensionality of data.}

  abstract = {Autoencoders (AE) are simple yet powerful class of neural networks that compress data by projecting input into low-dimensional latent space (LS). Whereas LS is formed according to the loss function minimization during training, its properties and topology are not controlled directly. In this paper we focus on AE LS properties and propose two methods for obtaining LS with desired topology, called LS configuration. The proposed methods include loss configuration using a geometric loss term that acts directly in LS, and encoder configuration. We show that the former allows to reliably obtain LS with desired configuration by defining the positions and shapes of LS clusters for supervised AE (SAE). Knowing LS configuration allows to define similarity measure in LS to predict labels or estimate similarity for multiple inputs without using decoders or classifiers. We also show that this leads to more stable and interpretable training. We show that SAE trained for clothes texture classification using the proposed method generalizes well to unseen data from LIP, Market1501, and WildTrack datasets without fine-tuning, and even allows to evaluate similarity for unseen classes. We further illustrate the advantages of pre-configured LS similarity estimation with cross-dataset searches and text-based search using a text query without language models.},

With rapid evolution of autoencoder methods, there has yet to be a complete study that provides a full autoencoders roadmap for both stimulating technical improvements and orienting research newbies to autoencoders. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of autoencoders, starting with an explanation of the principle of conventional autoencoder and their primary development process. We then provide a taxonomy of autoencoders based on their structures and principles and thoroughly analyze and discuss the related models. Furthermore, we review the applications of autoencoders in various fields, including machine vision, natural language processing, complex network, recommender system, speech process, anomaly detection, and others. Lastly, we summarize the limitations of current autoencoder algorithms and discuss the future directions of the field.},
